## ‚úÖ TODO (perhaps)

Once you start using the **ReplaceColorPalette**, it will become easy to choose the functionality to contribute. But if you already get everything you need from this package but have some free time, let me write here what I have planned:

- Respect the other colour models.
- Example for named colors with [UniColorName package](https://github.com/signmotion/uni_color_name).

It's just a habit of mine: writing down ideas that come to mind while working on a project. I confess that I rarely return to these notes. But now, hopefully, even if you don't have an idea yet, the above notes will help you choose the suitable "feature" and become a contributor to the open-source community.
